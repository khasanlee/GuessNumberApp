# GuessNumberApp 🎯

A fun and interactive mobile game where the app tries to guess the number selected by the user. This project was created to practice React Native fundamentals such as component-based structure, state management, and event handling.

## 📱 About the App

The core idea is simple:  
- The user picks a number between 1 and 100.
- The app attempts to guess the number using binary search logic.
- The user provides feedback ("higher" or "lower") until the app gets the correct number.

This app showcases key concepts in React Native development, including dynamic UI rendering and logic-based interaction.

## 🔥 Features

- User input and validation
- App guessing logic with history tracking
- Clean and responsive design using Flexbox
- Modular component structure
- Cross-platform support (Android & iOS via Expo)
